# IRIS Changelog

## [Unreleased] — IRISVOICEv.4

### fix: stop 9.1 GB CosyVoice3 model auto-loading at every backend start

**Root cause of PC becoming unresponsive**: `CosyVoice3-0.5B` weights on disk are
9.1 GB. `IRISGateway.__init__` was spawning a background thread to pre-load this
model 6 seconds after every backend start, regardless of whether the user was using
voice TTS. The RAM guard was set at 4.0 GB free — a threshold the model alone
exceeds. On a 16–32 GB consumer system already running Next.js + browser + Python,
loading 9.1 GB in the background saturated RAM and caused the OS to thrash.

#### `backend/iris_gateway.py`

- **Startup prewarm removed**: The `if _cosyvoice_model_dir.exists()` block in
  `__init__` no longer spawns the prewarm thread. `_tts_prewarmed = True` is set
  immediately so all "safety net" re-trigger paths are also suppressed.
  CosyVoice3 now loads **lazily** — only when the user sends their first voice
  message and `synthesize_stream()` runs for the first time. `synthesize_stream`
  already calls `_select_engine()` + `_load_cosyvoice()` itself; the prewarm was
  purely an optimisation that was killing the machine.
- **On-demand re-trigger removed**: The `if not self._tts_prewarmed` block in
  `_handle_voice` that spawned a second prewarm thread when voice started is also
  removed. Comments explain the lazy-load contract.
- **RAM guard raised**: `_prewarm_tts` RAM check raised from 4.0 GB → 12.0 GB
  (model = 9.1 GB + Python overhead + OS = minimum 12 GB headroom required).

### perf: eliminate PC-grinding memory spikes (frontend + backend)

Root-cause audit found 3 issues causing the PC to become unresponsive when both servers ran simultaneously.

#### `components/chat-view.tsx`

- **TTS word highlight (CRITICAL)** — `currentWordIndex` was stored inside the `Message`
  object, inside `conversations` state. Every 200 ms the interval called `setConversations`
  which mapped ALL conversations × ALL messages → ~10,000 object allocations per tick →
  50,000+ allocations/sec at peak. Each `setConversations` call also triggered the
  `conversations` useEffect which wrote the full JSON to `localStorage` (10MB+) every 200 ms.
  Additionally `messages` was in the `useEffect` deps so the interval was torn down and
  recreated on every keystroke, queuing 5–10 simultaneous intervals.
  **Fix:** `currentWordIndex` removed from `Message` type entirely. A single
  `ttsWordIndex: number` state is updated instead — one integer, zero conversation
  remapping, zero localStorage writes during TTS. `messages` removed from useEffect deps
  (words snapshotted at speak-start via local variable). localStorage persist debounced
  to 1 s so rapid state changes don't hammer disk I/O.

- **localStorage debounce** — conversations persistence now defers 1 s after the last
  change instead of writing synchronously on every mutation.

#### `backend/agent/local_model_manager.py`

- **Health check polling (HIGH)** — while waiting for the model server to start, the
  health probe fired every 0.5 s (2 HTTP requests/sec) for up to 3 minutes. This produced
  360+ HTTP calls during a single model load, thrashing the asyncio event loop and
  preventing other startup tasks from running.
  **Fix:** Exponential backoff starting at 1 s, doubling each missed poll, capped at 8 s.
  Worst-case load now produces ~25 health checks instead of 360.

#### `backend/audio/engine.py`

- **Audio frame conversion (HIGH)** — `_process_audio_frame` called `.tolist()` on the
  numpy int16 array before passing to Porcupine, allocating 512 Python `int` objects per
  frame × 31 frames/sec = ~16,000 object allocations/sec continuously while mic is active.
  **Fix:** numpy int16 array passed directly to `porcupine.process_frame()` — pvporcupine
  accepts any buffer-protocol sequence. Zero allocation overhead per frame.

#### `backend/voice/porcupine_detector.py`

- `process_frame` type hint updated to accept `Any` sequence (numpy array or list) without
  mypy complaints.

### fix: 10-bug audit — voice/text/tool pipeline hardening

Complete audit of the path from model load → voice input → LLM inference → tool execution → WebSocket delivery. All 10 bugs fixed.

#### `backend/agent/agent_kernel.py`

- **Bug 1+8** — Added `_normalise_endpoint()` static method: strips trailing `/` and `/v1`
  to prevent double `/v1/v1` URL on every OpenAI-compat request. Both `configure_lmstudio()`
  and `configure_openai_compat()` now call it. `configure_openai_compat(None)` safely sets
  `_model_provider = "uninitialized"` instead of crashing on `None.rstrip()`.
- **Bug 2+10** — DER loop Explorer phase called `self._tool_bridge.execute_tool()` without
  `await`, returning a coroutine object instead of the result. Wrapped with `asyncio.run()`
  and a ThreadPoolExecutor fallback. Tool calls now complete correctly.
- **Bug 5** — `_broadcast_inference_event` silently dropped WebSocket events when called
  from the thread pool (no running loop in that thread). Added `_broadcast_loop` attribute
  captured at startup + `run_coroutine_threadsafe` fallback. Inference console events now
  reach the frontend from background threads.
- **Bug 5** — Added `set_main_loop()` method and `set_main_loop(loop)` called during
  startup so the loop reference is available immediately.

#### `backend/main.py`

- **Bug 3+7** — Lifespan startup called `get_agent_tool_bridge()` (sync factory, never
  calls `initialize()`), leaving `_mcp_servers = {}` and all MCP tool calls failing.
  Changed to `await initialize_agent_tools()` which calls `bridge.initialize()` and wires
  all MCP servers.
- **Bug 5** — Added `agent_kernel.set_main_loop(asyncio.get_running_loop())` at startup.

#### `backend/agent/local_model_manager.py`

- **Bug 4** — Three occurrences of `asyncio.get_event_loop()` inside async methods
  (`load_model`, `_wait_for_ready`, HuggingFace download). On Python 3.10+ this raises
  `DeprecationWarning`; on 3.12+ raises `RuntimeError`. Replaced all three with
  `asyncio.get_running_loop()`.

#### `backend/iris_gateway.py`

- **Bug 6** — Both `chunk_callback` closures called
  `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(..., self._main_loop)` without checking if
  `self._main_loop` is None or still running. Added `if _loop and _loop.is_running():`
  guard around both calls — prevents crash when voice or text fires before the first
  async WebSocket dispatch.

#### `backend/voice/porcupine_detector.py`

- **Bug 9** — `__init__` raised `ValueError` on missing Picovoice access key and on no
  wake words configured, propagating through the audio pipeline startup and disabling
  voice entirely. Now sets `self._disabled = True` and logs a warning instead of raising.
  `_initialize_porcupine()` also degrades gracefully on engine failure. Added
  `is_enabled()` helper. All public methods no-op when disabled so the rest of the
  audio pipeline keeps running without a key or model file.

#### Bootstrap / tooling

- `session_start.py` — auto-syncs git commits into coordinate graph on every prompt (SHA-based idempotency)
- `.claude/settings.local.json` — Stop hook now runs `mid_session_snapshot.py` + `update_coordinates.py --auto`
- `bootstrap/on_git_commit.py` — removed (logic folded into session_start)
- `bootstrap/mid_sesssion_snapshot.py` — removed (typo duplicate)
- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `bootstrap/GOALS.md` — rewritten for platform/project agnostic use; quality gate checklist added to build sequence

### feat: DER loop fully wired into AgentKernel — spec compliance audit complete

### feat: DER loop fully wired into AgentKernel — spec compliance audit complete

All 11 gaps identified in the DER loop spec audit have been resolved.
18/18 spec tests pass (`backend/tests/test_der_loop.py`).

#### `backend/agent/agent_kernel.py`

- **Gap 1** — Added `_execute_plan_der()`: full Director→Reviewer→Explorer cycle
  with dependency-aware queue, per-step Mycelium signals, and ordered outcome
  recording (record_outcome → crystallize → clear → plan_stats).
- **Gap 2** — `self._task_classifier` (TaskClassifier) and `self._reviewer` (Reviewer)
  instantiated in `__init__()`. Reviewer's memory reference updated when
  `set_memory_interface()` is called.
- **Gap 3** — Added `_plan_task()`: DER-aware planner with maturity-aware temperature
  (0.1 mature / 0.25 exploring), `context_package` fed into planning prompt,
  `is_mature` / `task_class` / `context_package` parameters with safe defaults.
  Falls back to single-step plan on any model/parse failure.
- **Gap 4** — `process_text_message()` now classifies → assembles context → plans
  → routes `do_it_myself` strategy through `_execute_plan_der()`.
  `spawn_children` / `delegate_external` fall through to the existing ReAct loop.
  Entire DER path wrapped in try/except — ReAct is always the safety net.
- **Gap 5** — `mycelium_ingest_statement()` fires after planning with strategy signal.
- **Gap 6** — `register_address()` fires on the context package after plan injection
  when `is_mature=True`.
- **Gap 7** — Outcome recording sequence in correct spec order inside
  `_execute_plan_der()`.
- **Gap 8** — `mycelium_ingest_tool_call()` fires after every DER step (success,
  failure, and veto).
- **Gap 11** — DER constants (`DER_MAX_CYCLES`, `DER_MAX_VETO_PER_ITEM`,
  `DER_EMERGENCY_STOP`, `DER_TOKEN_BUDGETS`) re-exported at module level from
  `der_constants.py` for spec compliance.
- Added `infer()` adapter method so Reviewer can call the inference backend
  without a circular dependency.
- Added `_get_failure_warnings()` using `ResolutionEncoder` to surface high-signal
  Mycelium failure data into the planning prompt.
- Added `_run_step_direct()` for tool-less DER steps (direct model inference).

#### `backend/memory/interface.py`

- **Gap 9** — `mycelium_ingest_statement` proxy now passes `text=` keyword arg and
  `session_id=` (was silently dropping session_id).

#### `backend/core_models.py`

- **Gap 10** — `ExecutionPlan.to_context_string()` now includes
  `EXECUTION PLAN [{hza}]` header and `Reasoning: {self.reasoning}` line
  per spec format. Step count line replaced with `""` + `"Steps:"` separator.
