# Phase 3 Plan: Clockwork Transition

## Objective
Implement full Clockwork transition with mechanical gear rotations and discrete stepping.

## Files to Modify
1. `lib/transitions.ts` - Enhance Clockwork variants with gear mechanics
2. `components/hexagonal-control-center.tsx` - Integrate stepping animation

## Implementation Steps
1. Research gear rotation formulas for mechanical feel
2. Implement discrete stepping (not smooth interpolation)
3. Add gear rotation visual effect
4. Ensure icons stay upright with counter-rotation
5. Test mechanical precision feel

## Success Criteria
- Clockwork transition has discrete visible steps
- Gear rotation effect visible
- Icons counter-rotate to stay upright
- Feels mechanical and precise
- Navigation still works
- No console errors
